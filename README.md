# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
A spinoff idea from another repo Qwiki to create a java-like Shimeji (simple animated character) in React.js to interact with components on a webpage.\

## Functionallities
Currently it supports:\
- [x] Falling animation due to gravity.
- [x] Standing action animation.
- [ ] Walking, Climbing, Sleeping, and Dragging action animations.
- [x] Random next action animation and duration.
- [x] Play and pause when dragged.
- [x] Draggable Shimeji using react-draggable within ```<body>```.
- [x] Dragging Shimeji while it is falling.
- [x] Adjustable gravity and animation frame rate.
- [ ] Cloning Shimeji.
- [x] Remove Shimeji.
- [ ] Interact or climb onto each DOM element.
- [ ] More functionallities to come.
